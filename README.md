# 🎨 Hex Tool

A comprehensive web-based color tool for designers and developers. Learn how hex codes and color shifts work, explore color harmonies, test accessibility, and simulate color vision deficiencies — all in one place.

## 🌟 Features

### Current Features (v1.0)
- **Color Tweaker** - Precisely adjust RGB values individually or use quick presets (brighter, darker, warmer, cooler, etc.)
- **Color Harmonies** - Generate complementary, split-complementary, analogous, and triadic color schemes
- **Tints & Shades** - Create 10-step color scales using pure color mixing (no opacity) - great for backgrounds and linear gradients
- **Hue Rotation** - Visualize CSS `hue-rotate()` filter at 30° increments
- **Contrast Checker** - WCAG AA/AAA compliance testing with live preview
- **Color Vision Simulation** - Test how colors appear with protanopia, deuteranopia, and tritanopia
- **Theme Support** - 5 background themes for easy comparisons (Light, Dark, Navy, Forest, Burgundy)

### Planned updates (v1.0)
- **Styling** - Correct known visual issues, such as making "Darker" text lighter

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SneauxGirl/hex-tool.git
cd hex-tool

## 🎓 How It Started

This project began as a series of Claude.ai artifacts while I was learning about hex color codes and color theory. The evolution is documented in `docs/prototypes/`:

1. **v1** - Basic hex tweaker with RGB sliders
2. **v2** - Added color harmonies (complementary, analogous, triadic)
3. **v2.1** - Added split complementary harmonies
4. **v3** - Added tints/shades
5. **v4, prod version 1.0.0** - Full suite with hue rotation, contrast checker, and CVD simulation

Each prototype shows the iterative design process and learning journey.

## 🎯 Learning Goals

This project was built to:
- Understand how hex codes work at the RGB level
- Learn color theory principles (harmonies, contrast, accessibility)
- Save myself time and frustration when precision color editing
- Practice scalable React component design and state management
- Document the entire development process

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React** - UI framework
- **Tailwind CSS** (via inline styles) - Styling
- **JavaScript ES6+** - Logic and utilities
- No external color libraries - all algorithms implemented from scratch for learning

## 📖 Usage Guide

### Color Tweaker
1. Enter a hex code or use the color picker
2. Adjust individual RGB channels with +/- buttons
3. Use quick adjustment buttons for common transformations

### Color Harmonies
- Click any generated color to set it as your new base color
  Your prior base color will populate in its new harmonic space
- Use harmonies to build cohesive color palettes

### Tints & Shades
- Generate a full scale from light to dark
- Perfect for creating design system color scales and linear gradient mods
- Click any swatch to use it as your base

### Contrast Checker
- Automatically suggests a high-contrast pairing
- Edit the contrast color to test different combinations
- See WCAG compliance in real-time

### Color Vision Simulation
- Adjust severity slider from 0 (normal) to 1 (full color blindness)
- Compare original vs simulated colors side-by-side
- Test accessibility and appearance for color-blind users

### Theme Compatibility Switcher
- Toggle between 5 background themes for alt mode projects (Light, Dark, Navy, Forest, Burgundy)
- Edit themes in `src/utils/constants.js`

## 🤝 Contributing

This is a personal learning project, but suggestions and feedback are welcome! Feel free to:
- Open issues for bugs or feature requests
- Fork and experiment
- Share your own color tools for inspiration
- I expand this based on felt need - it might be done... but probably not
